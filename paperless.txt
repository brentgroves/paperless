DoEvents explained: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4526659/what-does-doevents-do-in-vb6

frmBackground.Timer1 
- interval 3 secs
- Enabled when frmBackGround loads
- Disabled when frmBackGround shows frmScreenSaver after 3 sec interval

Mainform.Timer1
-interval 5 milliseconds
KeyToSend = PGDN
If DocListView Then
        Me.Crviewer2.SetFocus
        Timer1.Enabled = True
LeftViewer
RightViewer
- After CrViewer1,CrViewer2,AcroPDF(0),(1), or (2) gets focus
acropdf(2) is for the larger view
this timer will send the pgdn,pgup,etc keys after focus has been set

Mainform.timer2
-interval 500 ms
-functions sends ^h key
basically trying to process all remaining events before hiding one of the
acropdf viewers

Mainform.timer3
interval 20 sec
if IdleTime has not been updated in the past 20 seconds then the refreshcmd is 
processed.
then call the refresh command
    If IdleTime < DateAdd("n", -20, Now) Then
        RefreshCMD_Click
        IdleTime = Now
    End If


 IDLETIME 
 set to now after RefreshCMD, documentlist, mainform.load,
 partselectcombo clicked, listbaritem clicked, any navigation key pressed
mouse is moved when screensaver is loaded

Mainform.timerscreenSaver
interval 15 secs
Because of this the refresh command never runs if there is a partnumber selected which
has quality alerts because the screensaver deactivates timer3 when it runs.  The fix may be
to enable timer3 when the screen saver is displayed.
When we have network problems makeconnections will be called and the screensaver will not be 
loaded

Mainform.timer4
interval 1 sec
Timer4.Enabled = False
DoEvents
MakeConnections

This is called from makeconnections in the case of a connection problem.  So every 1
sec MakeConnections will be called until the network comes up.

Mainform.timer5
interval 500 ms
prevents the documentList and ListbarItem buttons from being processed more than once every 1/2 second

Pieces.TimerCncPicker
interval 10 sec
closes the cnc picker dialog box

BUG:
ListBar_ItemClick - Check out this function to find out where the icons are getting set for each document.
